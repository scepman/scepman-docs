# Certificate Master Settings

This Section describes additional settings for the behavior of Certificate Master. All of these are optional, though, and we recommend just start with the defaults.

Settings can be added or changed manually if needed. Some changes can harm your service. Please carefully read all information about a setting before changing.

All of the settings described here are for the SCEPman Certificate Master App Service, not the main SCEPman App Service!
