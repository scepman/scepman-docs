# Health Check

You may configure the health check feature and corresponding alerting for the App Service to get a direct notification in case your SCEPman instance is no longer responsive.

{% hint style="warning" %}
After you have configured the health check and Alerting correctly it takes some time until the alert rule works properly. It is because the metric **Health check status** needs some time to get the information and the dynamic alert rule threshold needs some time to analyze the metric.
{% endhint %}
