# Intermediate Certificate

{% hint style="warning" %}
SCEPman Enterprise Edition only

If you want to use another Root CA as a primary authority, you can create an intermediate CA certificate. You can create the correct certificate direct in Azure Key Vault and download the CSR for signing with your Root CA. The signed request can be uploaded and merged into the Azure Key Vault.

## Key Vault Access Policy

You need to grant access to the Azure Key Vault to your user account to create the CSR and merge the Intermediate CA certificate.

1. Navigate to your Azure Key Vault in the Azure Portal
2. Click on **Access policies** in the left navigation pane.
3. Click on **Create** and choose the **Certificate Management** template, then next

4. Now search and add your AAD admin account in the **Principal** section, then next, next, and create

After adding the permissions, your Azure AD account is permitted to create a CSR and upload the certificate.

## Creating Intermediate CA Certificate with the SCEPman PowerShell Module

You can use the SCEPman PowerShell module version 1.9 and later to create a CSR for an Intermediate CA certificate. You can install the latest version of the module from PowerShell Gallery with the following command:

```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name SCEPman -Scope CurrentUser -Force
```

Then, you can tell the module the name of your organization to appear in the certificate:

```PowerShell
Reset-IntermediateCaPolicy -Organization "My Organization"
```

Optionally, you can modify some advanced settings to control the CSR content:

```PowerShell
$policy = Get-IntermediateCaPolicy
# change some settings of $policy
Set-IntermediateCaPolicy -Policy $policy
```

Finally, you can create the CSR with the following command (or a similar one according to your environment):

```PowerShell
New-IntermediateCA -SCEPmanAppServiceName "app-scepman-example" -SearchAllSubscriptions
```

The command will output the CSR that you submit to your Root CA for signing.

## Issue the Intermediate CA Certificate

Now, submit your CSR to your Root CA and retrieve your issued Intermediate CA Certificate. Save the certificate on disk (.cer), so in the next step, you can upload and merge it with the private key in Azure Key Vault.

### Special Steps for an ADCS Enterprise Root CA

If you are using Active Directory Certificate Services as an AD-integrated Root CA and hence must choose a Certificate Template, it must include the following Key Usages: "CRLSign", "DigitalSignature", "KeyEncipherment", and "KeyCertSign". KeyEncipherment is missing in the default template "Subordinate Certificate Authority", and furthermore cannot be selected on new templates. Please see below for a solution if you run into this problem. **This does not apply to Stand-alone Root CAs**, aka Offline Root CAs, as they take the Key Usages correctly from the CSR.

#### Outline

You can Duplicate the SubCA Template or use it as required. Then you just issue a certificate with the template based on the CSR. This certificate will have _the wrong Key Usage_ (0x86). Afterwards, you re-sign the certificate with an adapted Key Usage extension using `certutil -sign`.

#### Step by step

1. Request and issue a SubCA certificate.
2. Export the new SubCA certificate to a file (e.g. c:\temp\SubCA.cer) on the Root CA. Choose **Base-64 encoded X.509** format.
3. Create a file "extfile.txt" with the contents shown below to the Root CA (e.g. c:\temp\extfile.txt).
4. Start command line and execute: `certutil -sign "c:\temp\SubCA.cer" "c:\temp\SubCAwithKeyEncipher.cer" @c:\temp\extfile.txt`
5. The certificate SubCAwithKeyEncipher.cer now contains the requested key usage (0xA6). The thumbprint (signature) has changed, but the serial number hasn't.
6. The list of issued certificates in ADCS contains the old certificate. Since the serial number hasn't changed, you can manage the new certificate using the old handle, e.g. revoking the old certificate will revoke the new certificate. If you dislike this, you can delete the old certificate entry using `certutil -deleterow` and then import the new certificate using `certutil -importcert`.

## Upload the Intermediate CA Certificate

1. In Azure Key Vault, click on your certificate and press **Certificate Operation**
2. Now you can see the options **Download CSR** and **Merge Signed Request**

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-10-19-at-16.01.18.png)

1. Click on **Merge Signed Request** and upload your Intermediate CA Certificate. After you have uploaded the signed request, you can see the valid certificate in your Azure Key Vault in the area **Completed**

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Intermediate CA Certificate must be in PEM format (Base64-encoded). If you use the binary DER format, you will see an error message that says "Property x5c has invalid value X5C must have at least one valid item" in the details.
{% endhint %}

## Update Azure App Service Settings

The last step is to update the Azure App Service which runs the SCEPman with the new certificate information.

1. Navigate to your Azure App Service
2. Click on **Configuration** in the left navigation pane
3. In **Application settings,** you must edit the following settings:

AppConfig:KeyVaultConfig:RootCertificateConfig:CertificateName AppConfig:KeyVaultConfig:RootCertificateConfig:Subject

1. As value you must insert your new certificate name and the new subject name.
2. To complete this step, you must click on **Save** in the upper left part.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/screenshot-2020-10-19-at-16.06.40.png)

Please restart the Azure App Service and then navigate to your SCEPman URL. On the SCEPman Status page, you can see the new configuration and download the new intermediate CA certificate to deploy this via Endpoint Manager.

Please check whether the CA certificate fulfills all requirements by visiting your SCEPman Homepage. Check what the homepage says next to "CA Suitability". If, for example, it says _CA Certificate is missing Key Usage "Key Encipherment"._, you should go back to step [Issue the Intermediate CA Certificate](intermediate-certificate.md#issue-the-intermediate-ca-certificate) and correct the certificate issuance.

## Intermediate CAs and Intune SCEP Profiles

On the Android platform, the SCEP Configuration Profiles in Intune must reference the Root CA, not the Intermediate CA. Otherwise, the configuration profile fails. For Windows, it is the other way around: The SCEP Configuration Profiles in Intune must reference the Intermediate CA, not the Root CA. For iOS and macOS, we have no conclusive information whether one or the other way is better.
