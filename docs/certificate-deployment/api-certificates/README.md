# Enrollment REST API

{% hint style="warning" %}
SCEPman Enterprise Edition only
{% endhint %}

SCEPman features a REST API to enroll certificates. This is an alternative to the SCEP endpoints that require the SCEP-style of authentication, while the REST API uses Microsoft Identities for authentication. The protocol is also much simpler than SCEP.
