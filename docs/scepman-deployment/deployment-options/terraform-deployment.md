# Terraform deployment

If you are using Terraform to deploy your Azure resources, you can use our Terraform module to deploy SCEPman in your Azure tenant. You can find usage instructions and examples on the [module page in the Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/glueckkanja-gab/scepman/azurerm/latest).
