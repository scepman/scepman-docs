{% hint style="info" %}
If you have a license key, you can paste it into the field **License Key**. Leave it empty to use the free Community Edition of SCEPman.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
To maximize compatibility, for the **Organization Name** we recommend to omit

* language-specific special characters (e.g. ö, ø, é, ...)
* a leading space (spaces between words can be used)
* quotation marks
{% endhint %}

1. Select an existing **resource group** or create a new one (SCEPman resources will be deployed in this group)
2. Set the **region** according to your preferred data center location. It **must** match the region of the resource group - in case you have selected an existing one. It will be assigned to the resource group otherwise.
3. Set an **Organization Name**. This field is **important** as the organization provided here will manifest itself in the O= field of the Root CA that is going to be created later on.
4. Select your preferred **Update Channel**. By default, the [Evergreen approach](../../advanced-configuration/update-strategy.md#evergreen-approach) is configured as [update strategy](../../advanced-configuration/update-strategy.md). This parameter determines from which [channel](../../advanced-configuration/application-artifacts.md) the binaries for SCEPman will be loaded. For production environments, we recommend to use the **Production Channel** (default).
5. Click "**Review + Create**"
6. Click "**Create**"

Congratulations! The deployment of SCEPman is done. Please continue with the [next step](../deployment-guides/community-guide.md#step-2-perform-post-deployment-steps-permission-assignments) of the [Standard Guide](../deployment-guides/community-guide.md) to complete the installation of SCEPman.
