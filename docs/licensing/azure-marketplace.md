# Azure Marketplace

## Pricing Model

* SCEPman is offered as a **monthly or** **annual subscription plan** with different [User Segments](azure-marketplace.md#user-segments). The correct **user segment** is automatically selected by our platform based on the amount of desired users.
* All subscription plans consist of a **base fee** which includes a certain amount of users per subscription cycle - depending on the **user segment**. For example, the **base fee** for the user segment _SCEPman Enterprise Edition (M) 50_ includes 50 users per month.
* If more than the included amount of users is required, **additional users** can be added to the plan. For each additional user, we charge an additional per-user fee.

## Invoicing

* During the first subscription interval, your subscription fees are not immediately due after completing the subscription enrolment. Instead we will start billing once your cancellation grace period has expired.
* Upon every renewal date, you will be billed immediately.
* The related items should appear on your Microsoft Azure invoice (Pay-As-You-Go) the month after we have reported your fees to Microsoft.
* In the PDF invoice you will receive from Microsoft, all SCEPman fees are lumped into an item called "SaaS". The related Publisher is "glueckkanja-gab".

## User Up- and Downgrades

### Upgrades

* If you would like to upgrade your user count, you can do that any time during the current subscription cycle by navigating to your **SCEPman subscription** in the [Azure SaaS portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.SaaS%2Fresources) and by clicking "Open SaaS Account on publisher's site" (see screenshot below). This will re-direct you to our platform where the amount of users can be upgraded.

### Downgrades

* Downgrading the amount of users is currently not possible without cancelling the subscription.
* If you want to perform a downgrade, please cancel your current subscription from the [Azure SaaS portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseResourceBlade/resourceType/Microsoft.SaaS%2Fresources) towards the end of the current cycle by clicking "Cancel subscription" (see screenshot below) and re-subscribe with the desired user amount once the cancellation becomes effective.
